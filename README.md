The HAT is designed to function as a device that detects temperature. The proposed device is compact, passive and can convert thermal energy into an electrical signal output. It has practical applications for various groups of people, such as shipping security companies, farmers and civilians.

The HAT has several potential applications, including monitoring the temperature in greenhouses, detecting abnormal temperature changes in data centres, and tracking battery temperature on smartphones.

The HAT is designed to be easy to install, with a simple attachment mechanism that allows it to be secured to different surfaces, such as the roof of a greenhouse or the surface of a computer server. The device has different power input supply connections, allowing it to be directly connected to a power source or powered wirelessly.
Overall, the proposed HAT design has the potential to offer a cost-effective and practical solution for temperature monitoring in various settings, providing benefits such as energy savings, early fault detection, and improved battery care/life.
